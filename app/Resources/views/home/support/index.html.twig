        <p>Welcome to the support page for our technician application. Below you'll find answers to common questions and
            troubleshooting tips to help you get the most out of your app.</p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <dl class="qa-section">
            <dt>Q1: What is the purpose of this application?</dt>
            <dd>This application helps company technicians easily <strong>track and manage all their assigned cleaning
                    missions</strong>. It provides a centralized place to view job details, navigate to locations,
                document task completion, and submit job reports.
            </dd>

            <dt>Q2: How do I find the location of my next job?</dt>
            <dd>Once you select a job from your list, the application provides a <strong>GPS point</strong>. Simply tap
                on it to launch your preferred navigation app and get directions to the mission site.
            </dd>

            <dt>Q3: Can I add notes or take pictures during a job?</dt>
            <dd>Yes! Each job has a dedicated page where you can <strong>check off tasks, add comments</strong>, and
                even <strong>take pictures</strong> to document the condition of the signs, ATMs, store branches, or
                buses before and after your cleaning mission.
            </dd>

            <dt>Q4: How do I submit a completed job?</dt>
            <dd>After you've finished all tasks and added any necessary comments or photos, simply <strong>validate the
                    job within the application</strong>. This will automatically send your completed report to the
                administration for review.
            </dd>

            <dt>Q5: What if I lose internet connection while working on a job?</dt>
            <dd>This application <strong>requires an active internet connection</strong> to function. If you lose
                connection during a job, you may not be able to access job details, add comments, take pictures, or
                submit your work. Please ensure you have a stable internet connection before starting a mission.
            </dd>

            <dt>Q6: I accidentally validated a job before I was finished. Can I edit it?</dt>
            <dd>Unfortunately, once a job is validated and sent to the API, it <strong>cannot be edited directly by the
                    technician</strong>. If you've made a mistake or need to make changes to a submitted job, please
                contact your administrator for assistance.
            </dd>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
        <p>Encountering an issue? Try these common solutions:</p>

        <div class="troubleshooting-tip">
            <h3>1. "Invalid Credentials" or Unable to Log In</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Double-check your username and password.</strong> Make sure there are no typos, extra
                    spaces, or incorrect capitalization. Passwords are often case-sensitive.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Confirm your account status.</strong> Ensure your administrator has provided you with the
                    correct login details and that your account is active.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Contact your administrator.</strong> If you've verified your credentials and still can't log
                    in, your account might be locked or there could be an issue on the administration side. Please reach
                    out to your company administrator for assistance.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. App Not Loading Data / Error Messages Related to Connection</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check your internet connection.</strong> This application requires an active internet
                    connection to retrieve job lists, submit data, and access GPS points.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Ensure you are connected to a stable Wi-Fi network. Try turning
                            Wi-Fi off and then back on.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Cellular Data:</strong> Verify that cellular data is enabled for the app in your
                            device's settings. Check if you have sufficient data allowance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Move to an area with better signal.</strong> If you are in a location with poor cellular or
                    Wi-Fi coverage, try moving to an area with a stronger signal.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Restart the app.</strong> Fully close the application and then reopen it.</li>
                <li><strong>Restart your device.</strong> Sometimes, a quick device restart can resolve connectivity
                    issues.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. App Functionality Issues / Missing Features / Unexpected Behavior</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ensure your app is up to date.</strong> Many issues are resolved with the latest version of
                    the application.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Go to the App Store, tap your profile icon, and scroll down to see if
                            there are updates available for your company's app. Tap "Update" if one is shown.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Restart the app.</strong> Fully close the application and reopen it.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear app cache (if applicable to your device/OS).</strong> For some Android devices, you
                    can go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; [Your App Name] &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Cache. (Note: iOS
                    typically manages this automatically, and a reinstallation is more common for severe issues).
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reinstall the app (as a last resort).</strong> If updating doesn't help, try uninstalling
                    and then reinstalling the app from the App Store. <strong>Caution:</strong> Make sure you remember
                    your login credentials before doing this.
                </li>

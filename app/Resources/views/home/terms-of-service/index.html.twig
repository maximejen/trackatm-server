            <li>The App is intended for use by authorized technicians of TrackATM only.</li>
            <li>User accounts are created and managed by your company administrators, not directly by users within the App.</li>

            <li>You agree to notify your administrator immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="subtitle">3. Use of the App</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App is provided to assist you in managing and tracking your assigned cleaning missions, including viewing job details, navigating to locations, adding comments, taking pictures, and submitting job reports.</li>
            <li>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose and in accordance with all applicable company policies and procedures.</li>
            <li>You must not use the App for any unlawful or prohibited purpose, or in any way that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the App or interfere with any other party's use of the App.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="subtitle">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App, including all its content, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof), are owned by TrackATM, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws.</li>
            <li>These Terms grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App solely for your internal company-authorized use.</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="subtitle">5. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, without any warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or that defects will be corrected. Your use of the App is at your sole risk.</p>


        <h2 class="subtitle">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will TrackATM, its affiliates, licensors, service providers, employees, agents, officers, or directors be liable for damages of any kind, under any legal theory, arising out of or in connection with your use, or inability to use, the App, any websites linked to it, any content on the App or such other websites, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages.</p>


        <h2 class="subtitle">7. Termination</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the App, without notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Your company administrator also retains the right to revoke your access at any time.</p>


        <h2 class="subtitle">8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Your Company's Legal Jurisdiction], without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>


        <h2 class="subtitle">9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may revise and update these Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them. Your continued use of the App following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes.</p>
